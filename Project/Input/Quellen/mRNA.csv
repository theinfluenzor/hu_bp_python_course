Table S3Y. M. genitalium mRNA half-lives,,,,,,,,
"M. genitalium mRNA half-lives were reconstructed by mapping the experimentally measured half-lives of E. coli mRNA onto their M. genitalium homologs (column F). Half-lives were reconstructed on the basis of the half-lives measured for growth on M9 media because M9 media mostly similarly corresponds to the SP-4 media of M. genitalium and because a larger number of mRNA half-lives were reported for M9 than for LB media. The half-lives of non-homologous mRNA were imputed as the average half-life of all homologous mRNA. Finally, we adjusted the half-lives of several mRNA to satisfy the constraint that cotranscriptionally expressed mRNA have the same synthesis rate, approximately equal to the product of their expressions and half-lives.",,,,,,,,
