Table S3H. Media composition,,,
"In silico media composition. The media composition is based on the experimentally characterized composition of the SP-4 media on which M. genitalium is generally cultured, with additional essential molecules added to support in silico cellular growth. Non-gaseous molecules are added to the extracellular environment at the beginning of the simulation and either drain or accumulate over the length of the simulation. Baseous molecules are continuously perfused into the extracellular environment and are maintained at a constant concentration throughout the simulation.",,,
