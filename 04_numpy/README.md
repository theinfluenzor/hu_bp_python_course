# Numpy/Scipy

Here we will introduce the scientific computation packages numpy and scipy. The numpy package is a collection of data-structures for array and matrix based numerical computations,
similar to MATLAB by Mathworks. We will introduce basic matrix computations and linear algebra methods. Scipy is a collection of algorithms often used in scientific computing. It
tightly connected to numpy and we will cover the integration of ordinary differential equations and numerical optimization in scipy.
